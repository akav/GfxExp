Original repository:
https://github.com/zdevito/vdb

Ideally vdb integration is just to include vdb.h.
However, sometimes it is messed because of errors due to the order of includes or environments.
Therefore I (NOT the author of vdb) added vdb.cpp and vdb_interface.h to isolate the actual vdb source code from the others to make integration stable (at the cost of a slight effort increase).
Now you need to include vdb_interface.h instead of vdb.h and don't forget to compile vdb.cpp.

vdb.h comes from the above repository, but "static" qualifiers are removed from the APIs for this.
LICENSE also comes from the repository.
